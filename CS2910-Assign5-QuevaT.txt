Questions:
1)
select avg(elevation) from lake where type='caldera' and elevation is not null;

2)
select name, elevation from lake where elevation>(select avg(elevation) from lake where type='caldera' and elevation is not null);

3)
Select name,independence,area,gdp from country,economy,politics where code=Economy.country and code=Politics.country and gdp>5000 and area>400000 and independence > to_date('12-31-1950','MM-DD-YYYY');

4)
Select name,population,lake,river from city,located where (lake='Caspian Sea' or river='Rhein') and city.name=city;

5)
select name,"Total # of airports" from country inner join (select country,count(*) as "Total # of airports" from airport group by country having count(*)>5) on code=country order by name asc;

6)
select name,province,continent from city,encompasses where city.country=encompasses.country and continent='North America';

7)
select * from (select code from country where population>10000000 union
select country from economy where inflation>10) natural join country;

8)
select type,avg(depth) from lake where depth between 100 and 200 and depth is not null and type is not null group by type;

#This is wrong because we're only calculating the average depth on lakes whose depth is between 100 and 200. Rather, we want to calculate
the average depth and then select the groups whose average depth is between 100 and 200.
